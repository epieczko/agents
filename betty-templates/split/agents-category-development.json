defers database schema design to database-architect\n- **vs cloud-architect**: Focuses on backend service design; defers infrastructure and cloud services to cloud-architect\n- **vs security-auditor**: Incorporates security patterns; defers comprehensive security audit to security-auditor\n- **vs performance-engineer**: Designs for performance; defers system-wide optimization to
